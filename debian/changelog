git-hub (0.6.0~rc1) precise; urgency=low

  * GitHub Enterprise and other non-standard GitHub locations are now
    supported by making the GitHub API base URL configurable via `git config
    hub.baseurl` (#51)
  * `pull rebase` now forces the rebasing by default. This means the Committer
    and CommitDate metadata is updated in all the rebased commits (even if the
    rebase could be just a fast-forward merge). This way the information about
    who, what and when stuff got "merged" doesn't get lost.
    If you want to go back to the previous default, set the `git config
    hub.forcerebase` to `false`.  Also, to avoid confusion, the option
    `--force` was renamed to `--force-push` and the short alias `-f` was
    removed, as it shouldn't be a common operation in a rebase (#59)
  * `pull new` and `pull attach` got the option `--force` renamed to
    `--force-push` to match the new name in `pull rebase` (#59)
  * GitHub results are now fully  retrieved (before if there were too many
    results from a query, the query was only partially retrieved) (#61)
  * A serious encoding problem was fixed. This only manifested when the title
    of an issue was longer than 60 characters (#60)
  * If there are GitHub errors while rebasing, now more information is printed
    to ease the debugging (#57)
  * Several code cleanups and minor fixes (ef94d4b, d711c65, d39bbb9, 6f63324,
    bb83bd5, 7f027bb, 6cfc205)

git-hub (0.5rc1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a new `pull checkout` command to easily checkout a pull request. This
    is just a wrapper to the standard checkout command, but fetches and
    automatically adds the head reference of the selected pull request (#29)
  * Add a `--pause` option to `pull rebase` command. This makes a pause just
    before pushing the rebased result back to the repository and updating the
    issue. This is similar to `pull checkout` very useful for testing the
    exact result of the rebase (#39, #44, 0fe1615)
  * Allow creating pull requests from a headless checkout as long as
    `--create-branch` is specified (#33)
  * Plus some minor bug fixes and improvements:
    * Fix some unicode-related problems when unicode is present in commit
      messages. Bare in mind branch names with unicode characters are still
      problematic, see #46 for details (#45)
    * Improve warning message in `pull rebase` when not the pull request is not
      in a mergeable state (495f87e)
    * Fix a problem with interrupted `pull rebase` while `--edit-msg` is used
      (#38)
    * Add missing documentation for `pull rebase --force` (#40)
    * Don't requite `hub.upstream` configuration variable to be set for
      `clone`, but require authentication (#36, #32)
